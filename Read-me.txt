The appplication developed is an console app which takes input from user, I am learning to use the app as suggested using Producer-Consumer
pattern. Also trying to add valid unit test cases.

I have used Xunit for preforming unit testing but as not familiar, I am trying to understand TDD and write proper test cases.

Each operation has its own Interface declared and implemented in separete class files.

The application has been divided based on two functionality 
	1) Compute tax for an existing municipal
	2) Add a new Municipal

- The Municipal details are stored in MunicipalDetails.json file. The location for the file is stored in the appsettings.json file.
- Initially the user will be prompted for the functionality to perform.
- Based on the option selected the application operates taking timely inputes from the user.

File Operations: IFileOperations->FileOperations.cs(Methods:GetFile,ReadDataFromFile)
CalculateTax: ITaxCalculation->TaxCalculation.cs(Methods:GetSpecificMunicipalTax,GetMunicipalTaxDetails,ComputeTax)
Add New Municipal:IInsertNewMunicipalDetails->InsertNewMunicipalDetails(Methods:InsertDatatoFile)

Model: TaxModel.cs (To store the tax details for a Municipal)
